			<h2>My birthplace</h2>
			<div class="bit-columns">	
		    <p>	
			Intro:	I was borned in a city town that near my capital city Beijing. I love to live in my hometown because I can eat 
					a lot of our special local products. Even though it is not a big city, I still want to come back after I graduate 
					in the future. I have many emotions for my birthplace, such as my habits on eating and playing. For example, I 
					experiencedprimary school, middle school and high school times. Especially I like to appreciate some places' park 
					environment over there.</p>

			<p>		The first reason is I can stay with my relative and friends in my life. I don't want to move my living place becuase 
					my country has a lot of population. It is a really lively place and people always get up early and go public ground
					to exercise. Every night people don't have to work really late and those streets are lively atmosphere. Our weather 
					usually warm and cool in the evening. People won't be sick because our town has good living habits. Overall, I was 
					borned from an entertainment city. </p>

			<p>		In addition, my birthplace also has some famous building that were built by the past century. I even took many pictures 
					from here to record my grownth up changes. For examle, I like to play with my friends from some ancient gazeboes。It can 
					be a queit place for relaxing. However, Some of ancient building are destoryed because my city had built a lot of high
					buildings in recent years. Many of apartments subsititute those houses and our numbers of population are more than
					before years.</p>				 

			<p>		Finally, I prefer to introduce our environment of my hometown. Because of we even experienced a big disaster of 
					earthquake, our city had been reconstructed by government. Our government only took forth years to change its environment and
					returned to a perfect city now. I feel happiness because I was borned in a good stage. My birthplace also has many rich 
					resources, such as land resources and marine resources. Especially the famous coalmine resources, our city town also supports
				    our capital city and whole provincial capital demand. </p>
